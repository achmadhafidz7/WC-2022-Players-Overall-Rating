Data Source:
1. FIFA 23 Players Dataset = https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/1898257a1915cbd22dd226f16c66dc218dfb65fd6f062755f4d0243bb8365a99
2. Players in World Cup = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_squads

Due to not all players are included in FIFA 23 Players Dataset, therefore I input manually for the players 
that are not included in the dataset. I input the data base on the data from www.fifaratings.com

In this repository I inlcuded some files:
1. Fifa 23 Players Data.csv = FIFA 23 Players Dataset
2. world_cup_players.ipynb = notebook for cleaning the FIFA 23 Players Dataset
3. wiki_wc_players.ipynb = notebook for scraping the wiki page
4. fifa23_players_cleaned.csv = The .csv file from cleaning the FIFA 23 Players Dataset
5. wc_players_wiki.csv = The .csv file scraping the wiki page
6. WC 2022 Players OVR.xlsx = The Excel file I use to combine and input all the data
